I am a PhD student at NTU Singapore, where I am researching the field of AI application in software engineering.  

Current Research Interest:
- LLM usage for software engineering
- Automated Prompt Engineering
- LLM usage for code generation

I have worked on multiple data science projects in the past related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have experience in performing web scraping, automating, and deploying web scrapers at a scale of various social media, news websites, and online marketplaces such as Instagram, Lazada, Shopee, and Tokopedia.  

Alongside my academic pursuits, I have worked as an academic tutor where I have enhanced my communication skills.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any inquiries.
Currently not open to in the short term.
